# quick-cpp-library
Just some low effort libraries that are quite useful. Some of these libraries may have been created already but who cares because I made them again. Download if you need them. This is trash.

If you still want to use this library. Start with #include "qclock.h".

## things
### #include "qclock.h"
create a type with your own upper and lower boundries. clock type will loop around "artificially" overflow. As the name suggests. useful for clocks and other similar stuff.
### #include "qstring.h"
coming soon
### #include "qnotate.h"
coming soon
