# quick-cpp-library
Just some low effort libraries that are quite useful. Some of these libraries may have been created already but who cares, because I made them again. Download if you need them. This is trash.

## zap operations
Zap operations are fast and efficient but at the cost of some advantages the type offers. Read the instructions on each type to use zap operations at the right place and time. Zap operations do not effect other functions / operations.

## q operations (quick operations)
Q operations are quick to use but have less functionality than the regular operations. Q operations are still compatible with their parent operations.

## include these!
### #include "qclock.h"
Create a type with your own upper and lower boundries. Clock type will loop around, it will "artificially" overflow. As the name suggests. Useful for clocks and other similar stuff.
### #include "qstring.h"
coming soon
### #include "qnotate.h"
coming soon
